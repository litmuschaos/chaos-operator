## An experiment is the definition of a chaos test and is listed as an item 
## in the chaos engine to be run against a given app. Consists of reference
## to chaosGraph (which has chaos param details and runner spec) and also
## component information for the Object-Under-Test. The results upon running
## this experiment is relayed back to the chaos engine which invoked it.

## Experiments can be pulled from litmus charts and are versioned based on 
## chart.

## Charts should (not?) be auto-upgraded

spec:

  ## A low-level definition of chaos parameters which is fed to the executor
  ## for running the experiment.

  ## Some experiments need more info on the "object of chaos". For example, in case 
  ## of container crash tests in a multi-container app, it is necessary to know both 
  ## general app info (namespace, labels) as well as container name which has to undergo
  ## failures. This Component info is generally kept to a minimum and passed as ENV to 
  ## the actual chaos-runner/executor pod/container.
